    <h2 style="text-align: center;">What are Raagas?</h2>
    
    <div class="contraaga">
    <p style="text-align: center;">The notion of a Raag is at the foundation of Indian Classical Music. Simply put, a Raag uniquely defines a set of musical notes and their allowed arrangements to form a melody to evoke a certain mood. </p>
   
    <p "text-align: center;">In Sanskrit, a Raag means “something that colors your mind.” Within Indian classical musical systems, a Raag has the power to create very specific emotions in one’s mind. A range of emotions such as joy, sadness, happiness, romance, yearning, devotion, and more can be expressed through Raags. Some Raags are seasonal; they enhance the listener's mood through association with a particular season, such as spring or monsoon.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">In Western classical systems, musical structures often emphasize the notes to be performed while also prioritizing harmonic relationships. This is how the music might be expressed as happening “on the notes.” The focus of Indian classical music is such that microtonal nuances between notes draw the listener’s attention. The introspective qualities of microtones lead the listener to the experience of music “in-between the notes.”</p>
